# EuroCoinRecognition

## Project Overview

EuroCoinRecognition is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify Euro coin denominations from images. Utilizing Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, this project provides a practical approach to computer vision tasks, specifically tailored for recognizing currency.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Uses OpenCV to handle image manipulation and processing.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Leverages TensorFlow to train a convolutional neural network on images of Euro coins.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for predicting coin denominations from new images.

## Installation

To get started with EuroCoinRecognition, follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ilmastro/EuroCoinRecognition.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd EuroCoinRecognition

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To use the project, you need to run the prediction script with an image of a Euro coin:

# Predict the denomination of a Euro coin from an image
python predict.py --image_path 'path/to/your/image.jpg'

Code Structure
    load_data.py: Handles the loading and preprocessing of image data.
    model.py: Defines the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for coin recognition.
    train.py: Contains the code to train the CNN on the Euro coin dataset.
    predict.py: A script that loads a trained model and predicts the coin denomination based on a new image.
